# KaggleHousingData

- This repository was an independent project that used the dataset from Kaggle which included house selling prices and characteristics for the King Country area in Seattle, Washington (https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
- The project included three stages:

1. A database was created in MySQL workbench after the dataset was normalized to third normalized form. The entity relationship diagram is included in the projecty

2. Analysis of the dataset was performed in R which included retrieving data from the MySQL database into R and performing Principle Component Analysis

3. Visualization of house selling prices using latitudes and longitudes in Tableau (heat map was created)

- The code written here was adapted from the course MSCA31007 - Statistical Analysis taught by Yuri Balasanov. Professor Balasanov should be referenced since the original code that was modified in part for the purpose of this project belongs to him.
